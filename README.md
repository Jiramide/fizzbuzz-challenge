# The Fizzbuzz Challenge

Write the simple game of Fizzbuzz in as many languages as you can!

## Rules:

The rules of Fizzbuzz are simple, count to 100, except on every number divisible by 3, say "Fizz" instead of the number, and "Buzz" on every one divisible by 5.  If both numbers are divisible by both 3 and 5 (e.g. 15), say "Fizzbuzz" instead of the number.

    1. Do not include pre-solved problems (e.g. printing 1, 2, fizz, etc.)
    2. Do not copy a different solution.
    3. Follow the current format set:
        a. Put a comment with your name and the current date (MM/DD/YYYY) at the top.
        b. Make a single string for manipulation.
        c. Print the result each iteration on a new line for each number 1-100.
    4. Do not submit a solution for a language that's already been submitted.
    5. Do not codegolf your code, make it look pretty and to the standards of the .editorconfig.
    6. You are allowed to send pull requests to optimize any given language.
    7. Your submitted files must be in a non-binary, human readable format (UTF-8 encoding, preferrably).

Your code will be tested, and if it doesn't meet the output requirements, it will not be merged into the main branch.

All languages are accepted currently with no restrictions on being esoteric.  If it outputs correctly (without breaking rules), it's accepted.
